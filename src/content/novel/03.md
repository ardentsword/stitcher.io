"Follow the river northward, and it will guide you to the entrance of the White Woods," instructed Master Jonan. "A two-day journey on horseback will take you to the forest's edge, and from there, you will trek a couple of hours on foot to venture deeper into its depths. Leave your horses at the forest's edge, for the overgrown paths within are unsuitable for them."

June and Tom stood before Master Jonan, absorbing his words. This was their final task of their five-year training under his guidance. They would head into the White Woods. Not all the way towards the center, they would only travel to the border between human and elven lands.

Master Jonan reassured them: "you don't need to worry about encountering any elves along your path. They never come this close to our lands, they haven't done so for decades."

"Nevertheless," he continued, "I shall assign Adrian as your guide. He is well-known with the White Woods and has traversed it on numerous occasions. He knows how to navigate through them and lead you safely to your goal."

Their objective lay in finding the Southern Shrine, the closest one to Birchbrook, situated on the southern fringes of the White Woods. While their training under Master Jonan had encompassed a wealth of knowledge in advanced spellcasting topics, one crucial item with still missing: a spellcaster's staff.

"A spellcaster's staff can be as humble as a branch from a tree," Master Jonan had imparted, "but its true power lies in the binding spell that intertwines the essence of the spellcaster with their staff. This bond makes it an indispensable tool, and will open new ways of spellcasting for both of you."

June and Tom had spent countless hours practicing their binding spell in preparation for this very moment. Their staves had already been crafted from sturdy birchwood sourced from the village's surrounding woods. Each staff was adorned with intricate, curled engravings that had been burnt into the wood. At the bottom of the staves, metal tips were affixed to protect them from damage while traveling. Ropes were attached to both ends, allowing June and Tom to secure their staves on their backs when riding.

Master Jonan had shared tales of grand spellcaster staves, imbued with an assortment of precious gems and crafted from exotic tropical woods. "Perhaps one day you will create staves as splendid and powerful as those. However, do not be deceived by appearances. While some embellishments and gems serve a purpose, many spellcasters tend to overindulge in ornamentation without adding any practical value."

Master Jonan's current staff, a simple oak one, stood much taller than both June's and Tom's staves, reaching above his head. Despite its unassuming appearance, it was a potent and formidable tool.

"Off you go," declared Master Jonan. "I wish you the best of luck on your journey. Stay safe."

With those words, June and Tom mounted their horses and embarked on their quest, Adrian by their side.

They traced the winding path of the river, just as Master Jonan had advised. Adrian led their way with a determined stride. It was early spring, and the landscape was slowly coming alive again. The birch trees with their new leaves stood in solitude against the vast expanse of green fields.

After a couple of hours of travel, the familiar clusters of trees faded into the distance, leaving their home far behind. The river was still flowing to their right. Recent rains up north had caused the water to rise, and the water seemed full of energy. They made steady progress throughout the day.

As the sun began to set, it cast a golden glow over the land. They decided it was time to make camp for the night. They sought shelter beneath the branches of a lone tree, only a short distance from the river's edge. The world around them grew hushed as darkness crept in.

"We're quite exposed out here," Adrian remarked, scanning their surroundings. "Let's hope the weather remains kind to us tonight. Tom, you'll handle setting up the tents, and June, get a fire ready. We might need to use some of the dry firewood we brought along, as the wood from this tree appears too damp to ignite properly."

June couldn't help but be amused by Adrian's oversight regarding their spellcasting abilities, but she simply nodded and smiled in agreement.

"I'll scout the area a bit more and see if I can catch some fish for dinner," Adrian continued. "I'll return within the hour." With those words, he left.

June gathered twigs and a few sturdy lower branches from the generous oak tree that served as their campsite centerpiece. She piled the wood together, stepped back, took a deep breath, and began casting her spell. She threw it towards the pile, where it struck the wood with a resounding hiss, causing water droplets to evaporate in its wake.

For a brief moment, little seemed to happen aside from the gentle hissing and the faint glow of the scattered spell fragments nestled between the twigs and branches. Then, without warning, a powerful rush of air sounded, accompanied by a deep, resounding whoosh. In an instant, a magnificent fire blazed to life, casting a warm glow in the growing darkness.

"Of course, you get the easy task!" Tom's voice rang out from a distance as he struggled with setting up the first tent.

June couldn't help but smile. "Oh, poor Tom. Need a hand?"

"Yes, please," Tom sighed, his shoulders slumping in defeat. Adrian's tents proved to be a formidable opponent for a self-proclaimed mighty spellcaster like Tom.

The next morning unveiled a beautiful sunrise, casting a gentle orange glow upon the horizon. Yet, the biting chill of a westward wind swept across the camp. It carried with it the unmistakable touch of winter remnants.

Adrian had already set about preparing breakfast as June stirred from her slumber. Tom emerged shortly after, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.

"Slept well?" Adrian asked as he saw the tired look on Tom's face. Tom grinned faintly, not ready yet for conversation. 

Adrian continued, as they sat down around the crackling campfire. "Can you hear that?" he asked.

“What exactly?” Tom asked with a raspy voice. “Hush” Adrian said. “Listen.”

A distant sound carried on the wind, like the low rumble of thunder yet distinct in its rhythm and synchronicity. It was subtle, yet clearly present.

"I hear it," June said, "what could it be?" 

Adrian replied briefly, "I'm not certain."

"Where does it come from?" Tom asked while scanning the horizon.

The rhythmic sound echoed clearly in the distance. 

"From the west, several kilometers away. The wind carries its echo," Adrian answered, his gaze fixed on the unseen source. "We better proceed swiftly."

"But what about breakfast?" Tom asked promptly.

Adrian's responded "You can eat while we ride. Let's not waste any time. If that sound is coming towards us, we want to get going as soon as possible. Whatever it is."

They dismantled their tents and secured them back to their saddles. With the sun climbing higher in the sky, they mounted their horses, riding into the second day of their journey.

As they rode, the terrain shifted from the open grass plains into waving hills. With the gradual change in landscape, so faded the thumping sound. Soon, the only sound present was the continuous streaming of the river, slowly growing wider and more turbulent. Its banks transformed from serene sandbars to rocky precipices. Eventually, it veered into a deep ravine, snaking its way beneath them several meters below. The once serene waters now surged and churned beneath them. 

As evening approached, a sight emerged seemingly out of thin air — towering trees, a majestic veil that beckoned them forward. Shadows danced beneath the forest canopy. The air turned cooler, saturated with the earthy musk that permeated the White Woods. Nature itself seemed to hush, as if the forest held its breath in anticipation of their arrival. There was only the never-ending sound of the rushing river.

“We’ll camp here,” Adrian said as he ordered his horse to a standstill. “Tomorrow morning, we’ll make our way towards the Shrine on foot.”

They dismounted, their eyes widening in awe as they looked at the forest that loomed before them. It truly was a sight to behold, unlike anything they had ever encountered. The slender trees of Birchbrook were but mere saplings compared to the colossal oaks that now stood as sentinels of the White Woods.

The towering giants stretched high above their heads, their branches reaching out like hands towards the heavens. Still, sunlight managed to make its way through the foliage, casting patterns of light upon the forest floor. Patches of delicate Snowdrop flowers bloomed, their white petals a stark contrast against the earthy colors of the woodland. It was no wonder that the forest had earned its name — "White Woods."

After a hearty meal, exhaustion settled upon them like a heavy blanket. The strain of two days of relentless riding had taken its toll, leaving them yearning for respite. When night came, they fell into a deep sleep. Even Adrian found solace in the realm of dreams.

A gentle rain started to fall. They slept so deep that no one heard the sound in the distance, a sound as of rhythmic thunder.
