"Wake up, it's time." 

Tom slowly woke by Adrian's prodding, feeling tired after a short night's sleep. He had lain awake most of the night, mulling about what would happen today. It couldn't have been more than two hours since he finally fell asleep, and here was Adrian waking him already.

"Is it raining?" He asked, the trickling sound was the first thing he became aware of.

"Yeah, it started an hour or two ago."

"Too bad," Tom replied, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.

"No worries, General Oraa thinks it will play to our advantage."

"You've already seen him?"

"Yes, many are already gathered, I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer, but I really had to wake you by now. Let's get ready."

After a quick bite, they left the house, mounted their horses and rode through the empty streets of Arduina. The very last civilians had left the city by now, bringing a weird emptiness to the city. For a moment, only the sound of hooves clopping on the cobblestone road could be heard. Soon though, they became aware of the busy sound of an army preparing in the distance: metal clanking, swords being sharpened, horses walking all around, people quietly talking, with the occasional order shouted above all the other noise. The Arduinian army had gathered.

As they passed underneath the northern gate, an impressive sight emerged. Up until the last minute troops had been arriving — they came from towns who had pledged their loyalty to each other long ago. 

There were close to 500 swordsmen, 200 archers, and around 150 horsemen. Now that everyone had settled in over the night, the fields in front of the northern wall were dotted with grey tents. At the edge of the campsite was the big spellcaster's tent — the place where Tom was to meet the spellcaster's division. Adrian would report to the archer division, so after the passed the gate, they said their goodbyes.

"See you soon," Adrian said confidently.

"Good luck," Tom replied, as he turned his horse the other way, and rode towards the spellcaster's tent.

As Tom rode, he overlooked the battlefield from above the hilltop where Arduina was built on. The continuous gentle downpour was slowly transforming the foot of the hill into a soggy ditch. This is probably what General Oraa meant: the rain was working in their favor, constructing a natural barricade for the elven army to overcome.

When Tom arrived at the spellcaster tent, he was happy to see June already being there. Where Tom had just been in awe at the sight of the army, he now felt the same seeing June — she was a sight to behold, maybe even more impressive than the army — at least to Tom. She wore Arduina's official spellcaster garment: a purple tunic with a golden embroidered leave — Arduina's emblem. Above that, a hooded woolen cape, clamped together with a golden button. Her black hair knotted and her staff on her back. She radiated confidence and peace as her eyes met Tom's.

"Tom, right on time," Master Onu greeted, snapping him out of the moment. "Let's get you suited up, we're still waiting for Mari, and then we can start."

Tom got the same garments as June, although he didn't look quite a fancy as she did. 

Mari arrived a couple of minutes later. Master Onu gathered everyone as soon as all were dressed. "Spellcasters, let me lay out the plan for you," he said.

---

The first volley of arrows flew like a whisper through the air. The advancing elves at the other side of the field didn't seem to care. Their line kept slowly advancing. This first elven division counted around 100 horsemen and 500 swordsmen. Elves weren't tactical masterminds when it came to large-scale battles, but they had advantage in numbers.

As their line came into shooting range, they sped up the pace. Soon though, they were slowed down by the soggy ditch. The next volley flew. More than a handful of elves were struck and fell, but their line recovered quickly, and they continued their march. Once again they picked up speed now that they cleared the valley's lowest point.

Tom stood with the other spellcasters on their lookout hill, 100 meters behind the Arduinian line, looking over how both armies would collide soon. He had a splendid view of the battle taking shape, but only felt frustration that he'd had to wait. As master Onu had instructed, he looked out for potential spellcaster threats within the elven lines. There was nothing to be seen, yet. 

The elven line closed in, and Arduina's swordsmen prepared for impact. Archers fell back, making room for swordsmen, and shifted their focus to elven riders. The collision was weirdly silent. Tom expected for people to scream more. Most soldiers only groaned. Death was weirdly quiet.

Both sides suffered losses, but Arduina's army was clearly in better shape. Their archers had managed to dismount already half of the elven riders, and elven soldiers were falling left and right. Now Tom heard screams, not of pain, but of joy: Arduinian victory shouts carried over the battlefield. The human army felt invigorated at their initial success.

It was way too soon to declare victory though: from the woods at the edge of the field, a new elven line emerged. This one seemed smaller, but also more compact. It wasn't as much a line as it was a block.

Master Onu's gaze shifted immediately.

"I believe that's a spellcaster division. We wait until they've revealed themselves."

More waiting. Tom almost couldn't anymore. But he did. He was a soldier now, following command.

So he waited as he saw the block slowly advancing, slower than the first elven line. It counted no more than 100 elves. 

Suddenly, a burst of energy emerged as the group seemingly split. A huge spell flew towards the front line and hit. It hit elves and humans alike, but there were more human casualties, by far. A second spell was cast shortly after.

"Let's ride!" Master Onu commanded, "Tom, Hari, and Mari to the left; Sirian, June, follow me to the right."

The group split, riding their horses to either edge of the front line. They would attack the block from both sides. As Tom, Hari, and Mari rode towards the left edge of the line, ten shielded horsemen joined them. These men had one task: making sure Ardiunian spellcasters were as protected as possible. They reached the corner, and raised their staves, guiding their horses with one hand. 

They made a U-turn around Arduina's line, and now galloped over the battlefield towards the elven block in the center. A spell flew in their direction, cast somewhere within the depths of the block. Mari caught it without any hesitation, and made it dissipate into thin air in an instant. 

Suddenly, Tom realised he had no idea how they'd reach the center of the block; it was still protected by many elven warriors. Right when he wondered what he'd do, a new close-range volley was launched directly at the block. Dozens of densely packed elven warriors fell, exposing the elven spellcasters. Without hesitation, the elves unleashed a volley of spells, directed towards to front line. Five or six spells caused a huge explosion, causing men and elves to be thrown in the air. They didn't seem to care about friendly fire; the more damage, the better.

Mari was the first to start the counteroffensive. "Let's cast!" She proclaimed as she drew energy from the fire totems positioned across the battlefiel and threw her spell towards the elves. Tom and Hari followed shortly after, just in time to notice Master Onu, Sirian, and June in the distance, they had reached the other side.

The elven spellcasters were pinched. 

_They_, however, didn't seem to care — they formed a circle and started to cast unison spells. The first ones to be hit were Tom, Hari and Mari. They weren't able to catch and neutralize it in full, though they did manage to lessen its impact. When it hit, all three spellcasters were thrown off their horses, together with two of their protective horsemen. 

"What a weird sensation," Tom realised, as he was being thrown through the air. It couldn't have taken more than 2 seconds, but it felt like 20 seconds at least. Luckily, he and his fellow spellcasters were agile, they had trained for this. Tom remembered the lessons with Duke, the stable master, and instinctively put his hands forward, transitioning his fall into a perfect roll.

"Textbook," he said, smiling to himself.

"Watch out!" Hari cried as he ran towards Tom and caught a spell flying towards his back.

Tom suddenly realised he was facing the wrong way. Immediately, he turned around, just in time to catch another spell. 

"Thanks!"

"Thank me later!" Hari replied as he caught another spell. 

The elven spellcasters were now casting unison spells per two, and divided their focus on both spellcaster groups.

"Hari, we can do the same!" Tom yelled as he caught yet another spell, almost tripping over one the body of the two horsemen that were struck — they hadn't survived the blast. "Mari, come over here!"

Mari stood a couple of meters away from them: "I'm rather occupied at the moment," right then she caught a huge spell that was flying directly towards her. 

"We'll come your way!" Step by step, Tom and Hari made their way towards her. 

"We should unison cast," Tom said when they reached her. 

"We can't drop our defences," Mari replied.

"Can you cover us?" Hari interjected.

"I'll try!" she replied.

Tom and Hari positioned themselves behind Mari, now serving as a human spell-shield. She did an amazing job. Meanwhile, Tom and Hari concentrated on the energy from the fire totems. It was awfully difficult to focus on casting spells in the middle of the battlefield: the totems were pretty far away, and there were plenty of distractions.

They managed to close their eyes for a moment, and  feel the familiar sensation throughout their hands and staves. They elevated their staves in unison, feeling the energy of their unison spell surging throughout their bodies. As if rehearsed — which they surely hadn't — they threw a giant ball of energy forward. 

Initially, Tom feared it would be unstable and explode before it reached its target, but soon the ball picked up speed and covered the distance between them and their adversaries — 30 meters or more — in just a couple of seconds. Tom felt surprised that they had been able to cast it.

The elven spellcasters shared their surprise. They were able to catch the spell, but it still exploded and significantly rattled them. For just a moment, the elven spellcasters stood in astonishment for its power, but it didn't take long for one of them to shout some commands, and they were back at spellcasting.

It looked like the elves now had an advantage, them being together instead of split into two separate groups like the Arduinian spellcasters. 

"Shouldn't we try to reach the other side?" Mari asked.

She gestured one of the horsemen to discuss her plan. They had been occupied fending off the elven spellcaster's protective party. As he turned his horse, one of the elves saw their chance, and shot a quick spell towards him. It wasn't a particular powerful spell — a spellcaster could have caught it with ease — but that didn't apply for others.

The horseman fell to the ground, his face and chest completely charred from the impact. Shocked at the sudden death, Mari turned back to the enemy line and threw several channeling spells in quick succession. 

"Mari!" Tom shouted, "Give us cover!"

Mari turned to look at Tom, recovered to focus back on her task, when an arrow shot straight past Tom, and hit one of the elven spellcasters right in the chest. He fell. Tom turned around to see one of the riders lowering his bow, two seconds later, another spell hit the horseman. He fell. 

"Focus!" Hari shouted.

Meanwhile, at the other side; Onu, Sirian, and June had copied Tom's tactic: Sirian was providing cover, while Onu and June cast unison spells. Onu was definitely the most experienced spellcaster of them all, so their spells were even more powerful than Tom and Hari's. The elves were able to fend them off; but, for now, it seemed like the Arduinians were finally taking the offensive.

Tom soon realized how they had turned their seemingly disadvantage of being split, into a strength; they found a rhythm: Tom and Hari cast their spell, forcing the elven spellcasters to focus on neutralizing it. Only moments later, Onu and June threw theirs, bringing the group out of balance. When they went back to casting, Mari and Sirian fended off the cross fire. 

Suddenly, Onu and June's spell hit their target at exactly the right spot. Three elven spellcasters fell. Only three more to go. They had a clear advantage now.

It was too early to rejoice though, as one of the three remaining elves — the assumed commander — unleashed a spell in Syrian's direction. 

Tom watched from a distance, with a mix of awe and shock. He had never seen a spell like it: a continuous stream of energy — not a ball — where did this spellcaster draw energy from?

Tom witnessed Syrian fall to the ground from a distance. When the elven spellcaster stopped, one of the other elven spellcasters fell to the ground as well. Tom, Hari, and Mari stood perplexed. 

At that moment, as Tom's gaze met June's, she stretched her hand towards him as if she wanted to say something.

Whatever it is she wanted to shout, Tom didn't hear it.

The spellcaster had stopped to turn around, and had already begun casting his beaming spell. Tom could feel the heat closing in. At first, a lukewarm glow on his face, next a hot burning radiation. 

Then, nothing.
