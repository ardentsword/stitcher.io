"Wake up, it's time." 

Tom slowly woke by Adrian's prodding, feeling tired after a short night's sleep. He had lain awake most of the night, mulling about what would happen today. It couldn't have been more than two hours since he finally fell asleep, and here was Adrian waking him already.

"Is it raining?" He asked, the trickling sound was the first thing he became aware of.

"Yeah, it started an hour or two ago."

"Too bad," Tom replied, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.

"No worries, General Oraa thinks it will play to our advantage."

"You've already seen him?"

"Yes, many are already gathered, I wanted to let you sleep a bit longer, but I really had to wake you by now. Let's get ready."

After a quick bite, they left the house, mounted their horses and rode through the empty streets of Arduina. The very last civilians had left the city by now, bringing a weird emptiness to the city. For a moment, only the sound of hooves clopping on the cobblestone road could be heard. Soon though, they became aware of the busy sound of an army preparing in the distance: metal clanking, swords being sharpened, horses walking all around, people quietly talking, with the occasional order shouted above all the other noise. The Arduinian army had gathered.

As they passed underneath the northern gate, an impressive sight emerged. Up until the last minute troops had been arriving — they came from towns who had pledged their loyalty to each other long ago. 

There were close to 500 swordsmen, 200 archers, and around 150 horsemen. Now that everyone had settled in over the night, the fields in front of the northern wall were dotted with grey tents. At the edge of the campsite was the big spellcaster's tent — the place where Tom was to meet the spellcaster's division. Adrian would report to the archer division, so after the passed the gate, they said their goodbyes.

"See you soon," Adrian said confidently.

"Good luck," Tom replied, as he turned his horse the other way, and rode towards the spellcaster's tent.

As Tom rode, he overlooked the battlefield from above the hilltop where Arduina was built on. The continuous gentle downpour was slowly transforming the foot of the hill into a soggy ditch. This is probably what General Oraa meant: the rain was working in their favor, constructing a natural barricade for the elven army to overcome.

When Tom arrived at the spellcaster tent, he was happy to see June already being there. Where Tom had just been in awe at the sight of the army, he now felt the same seeing June — she was a sight to behold, maybe even more impressive than the army — at least to Tom. She wore Arduina's official spellcaster garment: a purple tunic with a golden embroidered leave — Arduina's emblem. Above that, a hooded woolen cape, clamped together with a golden button. Her black hair knotted and her staff on her back. She radiated confidence and peace as her eyes met Tom's.

"Tom, right on time," Master Onu greeted, snapping him out of the moment. "Let's get you suited up, we're still waiting for Mari, and then we can start."

Tom got the same garments as June, although he didn't look quite a fancy as she did. 

Mari arrived a couple of minutes later. Master Onu gathered everyone as soon as all were dressed. "Spellcasters, let me lay out the plan for you," he said.

---

The first volley of arrows flew like a whisper through the air. The advancing elves at the other side of the field didn't seem to care. Their line kept slowly advancing. This first elven division counted around 100 horsemen and 500 swordsmen. Elves weren't tactical masterminds when it came to large-scale battles, but they had advantage in numbers.

As their line came into shooting range, they sped up the pace. Soon though, they were slowed down by the soggy ditch. The next volley flew. More than a handful of elves were struck and fell, but their line recovered quickly, and they continued their march. Once again they picked up speed now that they cleared the valley's lowest point.

Tom stood with the other spellcasters on their lookout hill, 100 meters behind the Arduinian line, looking over how both armies would collide soon. He had a splendid view of the battle taking shape, but only felt frustration that he'd had to wait. As master Onu had instructed, he looked out for potential spellcaster threats within the elven lines. There was nothing to be seen, yet. 

The elven line closed in, and Arduina's swordsmen prepared for impact. Archers fell back, making room for swordsmen, and shifted their focus to elven riders. The collision was weirdly silent. Tom expected for people to scream more. Most soldiers only groaned. Death was weirdly quiet.

Both sides suffered losses, but Arduina's army was clearly in better shape. Their archers had managed to dismount already half of the elven riders, and elven soldiers were falling left and right. Now Tom heard screams, not of pain, but of joy: Arduinian victory shouts carried over the battlefield. The human army felt invigorated at their initial success.

It was way too soon to declare victory though: from the woods at the edge of the field, a new elven line emerged. This one seemed smaller, but also more compact. It wasn't as much a line as it was a block.

Master Onu's gaze shifted immediately.

"I believe that's a spellcaster division. We wait until they've revealed themselves."

More waiting. Tom almost couldn't anymore. But he did. He was a soldier now, following command.

So he waited as he saw the block slowly advancing, slower than the first elven line. It counted no more than 100 elves. 

Suddenly, a burst of energy emerged as the group seemingly split, exactly at the right moment. A huge spell flew towards the front line and hit. It hit elves and humans alike, but there were more human casualties, by far. A second spell was cast shortly after.

"Let's ride!" Master Onu commanded, "Tom, Hari, and Mari to the left; Sirian, June, follow me to the right."

The group split, riding their horses to either edge of the front line. They would attack the block from both sides. As Tom, Hari, and Mari rode towards the left edge of the line, ten shielded horsemen joined them to offer protection. These men had one task: making sure Ardiunian spellcasters reached their goal. As they reached the corner, all spellcasters held their staves, guiding their horses with one hand. 

They turned around the line, and galloped towards the elven block in the center. A spell flew in their direction, cast somewhere within the depths of the block. Mari caught it without any hesitation, and made it dissipate into thin air in an instant. 

Suddenly, Tom realised he had no idea how they'd reach the center of the block; it was still protected by many elven warriors. Right when he wondered what he'd do, a new close-range volley was launched, right at the block. dozens of elven warriors fell, being so close together. Immediately, the elven spellcasters were exposed. Without hesitation, they unleashed a volley of spells themselves, directed towards to front line. Five or six spells caused a huge explosion, causing dead men and elves — or better, random body parts — to be thrown in the air.

Mari was the first one to start to counteroffensive. "Let's cast!" She proclaimed, and threw her spell towards the elves. Tom and Hari followed shortly after, just in time to notice Master Onu, Sirian, and June in the distance, they had reached the other side.

The elven spellcasters were trapped.

_They_, however, didn't seem to mind — they formed a circle and cast spells in unison. They were able to all work together and their spells were formidably powerful. 

The first one of these unison spells hit Tom, Hari and Mari. They weren't able to catch and neutralize it in full, though they did manage to lessen its impact. When it hit, all three riders were thrown off their horses. 

It's a weird sensation, Tom realised, as he was being thrown through the air. It couldn't have taken more than 2 seconds, but it felt like 20 seconds at least. He and his fellow spellcasters were agile though, they had trained for this. Tom remembered the lessons with Duke, the stable master, and instinctively put his hands forward, transitioning his fall into a perfect roll.

"Textbook," he said, smiling to himself.

"Watch out!" Hari cried as he ran towards Tom and caught a spell flying towards his back.

Tom suddenly realised he was facing the wrong way. Immediately, he turned around, just in time to catch another spell. 

"Thanks!" He shouted at Hari, who was now standing beside him.

"Thank me later," he replied as he caught yet another spell. 

The elven spellcasters were now casting unison spells per two, and focussing on one or two Arduinian spellcasters at once.

"Hari, we can do the same!" Tom yelled. "Mari, come over here!"

Mari stood a couple of meters away from them when she shouted: "I'm rather occupied at the moment," right when she caught a huge spell flying towards her. 

"Then we come to you!" Step by step, Tom and Hari made their way towards her, continuing to catch spells that kept flying towards them. 

"We should unison cast," Tom said when they reached her. 

"I don't think we have time for that," Mari replied.

"Can you cover us?" Hari interjected.

"I'll try!" she replied.

Tom and Hari positioned themselves behind Mari, who now served as a human spell-shield. She did an amazing job. Meanwhile, Tom and Hari concentrated on the surrounding energy. It was awfully difficult to focus on casting spells in the middle of the battlefield.

They closed their eyes for a moment, once they felt that familiar sensation throughout their hands and staves, they elevated those staves in unison, feeling the energy of their combined spell surging throughout their bodies. As if rehearsed — which they surely hadn't — they threw their unified ball of energy forward. 

Initially, Tom feared it would be unstable and explode before it reached its target, but soon the ball picked up speed and covered the distance between them and their adversaries — 30 meters or more — in just a couple of seconds. Tom and Hari watched it fly, surprised with themselves that they had cast it.

The elven spellcasters shared their surprise. They were able to catch the spell, but it still exploded and significantly rattled them. For just a moment, the elven spellcasters stood in astonishment for its power, but it didn't take long for one of them to shout some commands, and they were back at spellcasting.

At this point, the elves clearly had an advantage, all being together compared to the Arduinian spellcasters split in two separate groups. 

"We should try to reach the other side!" Mari proclaimed.

She gestured one of the horsemen to discuss her plan. As he turned his horse, one of the elven spellcasters saw his chance, and shot a quick spell towards him. It wasn't a particular powerful spell — a spellcaster could have caught it with ease — but that didn't apply for others.

The horseman fell to the ground, his face and chest completely charred from the spell's impact. Dead. In shock at the sudden death, Mari turned back to the enemy line and threw several channeling spells in quick succession. 

"Mari!" Tom shouted, "Give us cover!"

Mari turned to look at Tom, recovered and wanted to focus on her task, when an arrow shot straight past Tom, and hit one of the elven spellcasters right in the chest. He fell. Tom turned around to see one of the riders lowering his bow.

One down. Tom nodded at the rider, then focused back on the group in front.

Meanwhile, at the other side, Onu, Sirian, and June had copied Tom's tactic: Sirian was providing cover, while Onu and June cast unison spells. Onu was definitely the most experienced spellcaster of them all, so their unison spells were even more powerful than Tom and Hari's. The elves were able to fend them off; but, for now, it seemed like the Arduinians were finally taking the offensive.

Soon, Tom and Hari, Onu and June turned their seemingly disadvantage of being split, into a strength. They found a rhythm: Tom and Hari cast their spell, forcing the elven spellcasters to focus on neutralizing it. Only moments later, Onu and June threw theirs, bringing the group out of balance. When they went back to casting, Mari and Sirian fended off the cross fire. 

Suddenly, Onu and June's spell hit their target at exactly the right spot. Three elven spellcasters fell. Only three more to go. They had a clear advantage now.

It was too early to rejoice though, as one of the three remaining elves — the assumed commander — unleashed a spell in Syrian's direction. 

Tom watched from a distance, with a mix of awe and shock. He had never seen a spell like it: a continuous stream of energy — not a ball — where did this spellcaster draw energy from?

In an instant, Tom witnessed Syrian fall to the ground from a distance. The spellcaster stopped. Tom, Hari, and Mari stood perplexed. Tom's eyes crossed June's.

"Watch out!" she cried from afar, stretching one hand towards Tom, as if she wanted to pull him away from the danger.

Only then Tom realised the spellcaster had stopped to turn around, and was already casting his beaming spell. Tom could feel the heat closing in. At first, a lukewarm glow on his face, next a hot burning radiation. Then, nothing.
