The steady drizzle had turned the campsite into a vast expanse of mud, the footfalls of dozens of soldiers creating a squelching symphony. Large awnings had been raised, providing a semblance of shelter, but the moisture hung thick in the air, making everything feel damp and cold. June and Adrian stood at the outskirts of the crowd, close enough to hear but distanced enough to avoid the thick press of bodies.

Then, with the punctuality that only a general could command, general Oraa stepped onto a raised platform. His presence was like the sudden quieting of a storm. He had an air of unmistakable authority, his sharp gaze taking in every face.

"People," he began, his voice strong and resonant, "Today, we face danger. For months, elves have plundered and killed in our lands. Today we bring them to a halt. They might outnumber us, but we have our strengths, and we have a plan."

June's gaze flitted to the side, landing on Clanswoman Lysan. The leader's face was a mask of concentration, but her posture suggested quiet confidence as she listened to general Oraa laying out the plans.

"Our strategy today is mostly defensive. We let the elven scum exhaust themselves as much as possible. We have the high ground, and we have the rain. The mud will hinder their movements. All we have to do is counter their offensive long enough for them to be exhausted, then we hit them with the final blow. We stand steady and strong."

The crowd nodded confidently, as Adrian leaned in close to June, murmuring, "We're clearly in a better position." June nodded, however she was mostly wondering about _her_ role today.

"Now, about spellcasters," the general continued, as if he guessed June's thoughts. "Our scouts haven't detected any, but we can be certain they are there. Master Onu, you have the word."

"Thank you, general," master Onu said as he stepped on the platform.

"With every village raid over the past months, there have been a handful of spellcasters present. It's safe to assume there will be at least a handful of them here today as well. I'm leading a spellcasters division, whose only task is to neutralize elven ones." 

June felt a surge of adrenaline: it's her that master Onu was talking about.

"We're with six in total, so we need all the cover available. Lieutenants, you make sure to guard over the safety of these spellcasters at all costs. We are the only line of defence against elven spellcasters."

"We will provide you with a group of horsemen as well", clanswoman Lysan interjected. "You'll be protected as good as possible."

"Thank you, clanswoman," master Ony replied before continuing. "Now, you've all seen the fire totems placed across the battlefield. These are essential for us to do our spellcasting. They are loaded with enough fuel to burn for two days, and the rain won't do them much harm. You have to make sure they are kept from being destroyed by elven warriors."

The murmurings of agreement swelled around June and Adrian. The plan seemed solid. Now the discussion continued, the lieutenants asking followup questions for general Oraa and master Onu, and June found herself invigorated by the sense of unity and purpose around her.

As the meeting wound down, June decided to already head to the spellcaster's tent where all spellcasters were to gather on hour from now. She hadn't anything else to do, and figured it to be the best place to be.

"I'll go wake him," Adrian replied when June had shared her plans. "In case I don't see you before the battle starts," he continued, "I wish you the best of luck. I'm sure you'll make us proud."

It was close to midday when both armies gathered on opposite sides: the Ardiunian army on top of the hill, the elves at the forest edge, a couple of hundred meters away. The rain had just stopped an hour ago, but the ground was still soggy and full of mud. All spellcasters stood on their horses behind the defensive line, overlooking the battlefield. The fire totems were blazing steadily, bright dots scatted across the pale field.

Suddenly, a rhythmic sound echoed across the field. That faintly familiar sound of thumping thunder in the distance. It took June's thoughts back to Birchbrook for a moment, their journey to the white woods, and the grief she felt. These feelings would fuel her today. 

When she focussed again, the elves were clearly in sight. They had begun their charge. With every beat of her heart, June could feel the approaching tremor of hundreds of feet. General Oraa's voice cut through the noise. "Hold!" he commanded, and every soldier stood their ground, waiting for the right moment.

As the first lines met, June could see the tactical mastermind of general Oraa. Elves were falling left and right as they tried to charge the defensive line. Arduinian arrows struck down numerous elves, but the elven crossfire didn't do much harm. Right in time, shield bearers stepped forward, creating a protective barrier against elven volleys. Arrows thudded into the raised shields, while human archers retaliated, sending their own volleys into the elven ranks.

Soon after, a new group of elves emerged from the woods, it couldn't be more than a hundred elves, moving forward as a single block. 

"I believe that's a spellcaster division." Master Onu declared. "We wait until they've revealed themselves."

June was surprised when the block stopped at the bottom of the hill, just outside the range of the Arduinian arches. Suddenly, the group opened up, and one — no two — spells flew towards the colliding lines. It hit elves and humans alike, but there were more human casualties, by far.

"Let's ride!" Master Onu commanded. Tom, Hari, and Mari rode to the left side of the line; June, and Sirian followed master Onu to the right. 

As they rode towards the flank of the elven spellcaster group, June already started to draw energy from the totems. She raised her staff and shot spells in quick succession, trying to break the group's defences.

Soon, they came to a standstill, throwing spells back and forth. They drew energy, not only from the fire totems, but also by catching their opponent's spells, absorbing them, and throwing new ones at them. Soon, June and master Onu cast unison spells together, making even more powerful spells, while Sirian gave them cover. Balls of energy flew back and forth, the sound of explosions all around them, all the while their protective cavalry guard fended off elven assailants.

They were casting their tenth or eleventh unison spell when June thought back to the moment when she found master Jonan laying on the ground, two arrows in his chest, one of his hands still gripping the broken part of his staff, his blank eyes staring into nothingness. She felt a surge of rage as she cast her spell, channeling that energy into it. 

Master Onu was surprised for a moment when he felt June's power adding to their spell, but didn't stop casting. Soon the ball of energy flew towards the elven spellcasters at an amazing speed. A huge explosion followed, June could feel the tremors in her feet as three elven spellcasters fell — they hadn't been able to catch it. 

Half surprised by what she had just done, June quickly refocused, and got to casting the next spell. Too late did she notice the warm glow of beaming energy piercing through Sirian as he was covering them. Only half aware of what just happened, she turned to look at the elves, just in time to see one of them fall to the ground, while another one was turning around.

Her gaze shifted to her fellow spellcasters on the other side. Her eyes met Tom's. Instinctively, she stretched out her hand as if she wanted to pull him away. Next, she prepared to shout something, but right before words came out of her mouth, Tom was pierced by the beam of energy. She saw him fall on his knees, his blank eyes staring into nothingness, then onto his face in the mud a moment later. 

Then, nothing.
