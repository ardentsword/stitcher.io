The forest floor was covered in a thick layer of decaying leaves. It released a musty aroma that filled the air. The relentless spring rains had saturated the earth, leaving it damp and soggy. Last night's downpour had further soaked the forest, intensifying the pervasive moisture. 

Upon entering the woods, they had bid farewell to the river that veered eastward. Now they followed a path obscured by overgrown vegetation. The once-defined trail had succumbed to nature's reclamation, melding with the surrounding vegetation. A dense morning fog rose from the ground, casting an ethereal veil over the forest.

Despite the diminished visibility, Adrian possessed an unwavering sense of direction. He led the way with certainty, guiding them on a two-hour trek towards their destination — the Southern Shrine. 

While Tom and June had yet to lay eyes on the shrine, Master Jonan's description had painted a vivid picture in their minds.

"It's a stone, standing tall at two meters, nestled at the base of one of the mightiest oaks in the entire forest," Master Jonan had explained. "Engraved upon it is the binding spell. This shrine, unlike the others, is a human creation, the last mark of our presence in the White Woods."

“There are no birds,” Tom suddenly realized, when the quiet of the forest became apparent, now that the river was gone.

“There are none,” Adrian said.

“How come?” Tom asked.

Adrian paused for a moment, considering the question while he tried to make a path through a densely packed area. "There are theories," he began, "some attribute it to the mystical forces that dwell within these woods. Others claim that the elves have hunted the birds and other wildlife to near extinction."

“What do you think is the reason?” Tom asked.

“I think it’s probably the elves. They are used to getting what they want, at any cost. They’ve lived at the northern edge of this forest for centuries, and these have their hunting grounds for ages.”

“Shouldn’t we be cautious if elves are around?” June intervened.

A reassuring smile played upon Adrian's lips. “No worries,” Adrian said, “I have ventured through these parts of the forest countless times, and I can assure you that there are no elves here. As Tom observed, the absence of birds is a testament to the absence of elves as well. There’s nothing of value for them to find here”

“Have you ever seen an elf?” Tom asked, his curiosity piqued.

"No, I haven't, and I wouldn't want to," Adrian replied, a hint of caution lacing his words. "They are greedy creatures, consumed by their own desires. Rumor has it many are formidable spellcasters though, which could prove dangerous if one were to encounter them. But, to be honest, I cannot say for certain."

June, intrigued by what Adrian's knowledge of the White Woods, interjected, "What brings you to these woods? You mentioned that you've been here many times before."

Adrian thought for a moment, carefully considering his words. He responded, "Let's just say I assist in the transportation of valuable items between cities."

Now it was Tom who probed further, "What kind of valuables? Are you a smuggler?"

“I am not.” Adrian replied, not giving any more information.

Taken aback by Adrian's mysterious demeanor, Tom persisted, "Then what is it that you do exactly?"

A subtle smile played upon Adrian's lips. “I would prefer to keep my occupations private, if you don't mind, Tomas. However, I assure you, I’m not involved in any illegal activities. Master Jonan vouched for me when he asked me to guide you on this journey. I hope you have faith in his judgment.”

With that, the conversation reached an impasse, and the group proceeded in silence, venturing deeper into the enchanting woods; Tom and June still awestruck by the grandeur of the towering trees that enveloped them.

---

"We're here," Adrian said calmly as he came to a sudden stop. Tom, startled from his deep thoughts, snapped back to the present moment. He had been immersed in Master Jonan's instructions, replaying them in his mind. Also, the mystery of Adrian's occupations lingered in his thoughts, but he did find solace in Master Jonan's trust in their guide.

June, on the other hand, had been fully attentive throughout the entire journey. Her anticipation grew with every step, her excitement reaching its peak at the sight of the shrine. Master Jonan's description had been spot-on: a large rock with engraved text. Though the rock itself may not have been impressive, the towering oak tree that stood beside it, its roots embracing the shrine, added an air of grandeur.

"Now what?" Tom asked Adrian, a touch of impatience in his voice. "Can we proceed?"

"Guiding you here was my area of expertise. As for what comes next, I'm afraid I don't possess that knowledge. It’s your turn now." Adrian replied.

"I'll go first," June declared.

// TODO from here on out

She gently placed her backpack beside Tom and Adrian, their presence providing a sense of comfort and support. With careful steps, she approached the shrine, her eyes fixed on the intricate carvings that adorned its surface. These were the exact words that Master Jonan had imparted to them. 

In her hands, she held her staff, a simple birch branch that had been transformed through their collaborative efforts. The carvings bore slight imperfections, their edges marked by the faint traces of burning, but Master Jonan had reassured them that it would suffice.

A smile graced June's lips as she held her staff before her, a surge of nostalgia flooding her thoughts. The years of training alongside Master Jonan replayed in her mind, the countless hours of practice and the unwavering dedication that had brought her to this moment.

"Today is a momentous day," she whispered to herself.

She closed her eyes, immersing herself in the energy that surrounded her. The presence of the shrine was palpable, radiating a power that surpassed anything she had encountered before. Even the intense heat of the coal fires they had used for energy during their training paled in comparison to the energy emanating from the stone before her.

With focused determination, she repeated the phrases taught by Master Jonan in her mind, allowing the energy to flow through her. As she channeled that energy, a familiar warmth enveloped her hands. Soon though, she sensed a shift. 

A surge of energy pulsed between her hands and staff, surpassing whatever feeling she ever had while casting spells before. The grip between her hands and her staff intensified, as if her staff had become an extension of herself. She felt that she was able to absorb much more energy from her surroundings than ever before.

Suddenly she felt overwhelmed by the influx of power. Opening her eyes, she took a deep breath, and directed a stream of energy towards the stone. The spell she cast was the most potent she had ever witnessed, its intensity absorbed by the stone with a resounding whoosh.

Turning to face Adrian and Tom, she couldn't suppress her smile. "That was unexpected," she remarked playfully. "I hope I didn't startle you too much?"

Adrian, his eyes wide with surprise, spoke up. "June, take a look at your staff!"

Quickly June turned her gaze, in fear that her staff might be broken. Instead, it had undergone a transformation. It had morphed into a magnificent bright white staff, its engraved markings now sharp and radiant. The metal tip gleamed brighter than ever before.

With a mix of awe and affection, June cradled her staff in her hands, marveling at its newfound beauty. It was now truly hers.

“My turn!” said Tom, who couldn’t wait any longer.

It was late in the afternoon when the group emerged from the woods, both staffs held proudly by June and Tom. Tom's staff differed from June's, shorter yet sturdier, and with engravings that glowed with a greater intensity. While he had experienced the same powerful energy as June, he had managed to contain it within himself and his staff.

As they prepared their horses for the journey back, Adrian took the opportunity to ask some questions. "So, what are your plans after we return?" he said.

June responded, "We plan on traveling to Arduina next week. Master Jonan mentioned a spellcaster master there who can continue our training."

Adrian's curiosity persisted as he probed further, "And then what? Will you join the army?"

June nodded, her expression determined. "Most likely. It seems that teaching other spellcasters or serving in the armed forces are the main options. Given the scarcity of spellcasters, the latter seems more practical. Besides, Master Jonan emphasized the crucial role of spellcasters in defending against elven raids."

Adrian's tone conveyed a hint of skepticism. "It sounds like a bleak future, where your choices are limited to teaching or fighting."

His voice filled with conviction, Tom interjected. "Master Jonan taught us that each of us has a role to play. As spellcasters, we have a responsibility to contribute to the defense of our land against elven threats."

Before Adrian could continue his line of questioning, he was interrupted by June, her attention focused elsewhere. "Hold on," she said, her voice tense. "Can you hear that?"

A faint but distinct sound carried on the wind, capturing their attention. Adrian listened intently, confirming its presence. The sound of thunder in the distance, but more rhythmic.

"Yes," he said. "It's the same sound we heard two days ago." His concern grew. "I think it's wise for us to mount our horses and ride back as soon as possible."

More apprehensive than before, they quickly mounted their horses and set off south, following the course of the river.

They had been riding for only a short period of time, when Adrian instructed them to halt for a moment. his eyes darted from side to side, his brow furrowed with worry. "It's closing in," he said. "We're not riding straight into it, but it's getting nearer."

Without a moment's hesitation, Adrian veered his horse to the west, scanning the horizon in search of answers. Out of nowhere, two tiny dots appeared on the horizon, drawing their attention like moths to a flame. Adrian's gaze hardened.

"What in the realms is that?" Tom's voice cracked with tension as he joined Adrian's side.

Adrian's voice was filled with uncertainty. "Could be horse riders, but I can't say for certain."

"Travelers like us, maybe?" Tom's question hung in the air, unanswered.

Adrian's response came swift and foreboding. "Whoever they are, they've spotted us and are closing in fast!"

The group stood still, uncertainty filling the air as they awaited the strangers' approach. Then, without warning, a bright pale green flash emanated from one of the dots.

"A spell! That's a spell!" June's voice quivered, urgency tainting her words. "We need to ride!"

With swift movements, the three turned their horses and urged them into a gallop, racing southward. The thundering of hooves and the wind rushing past their ears filled their senses. As they rode, Adrian glanced back intermittently, his eyes widening with each glance.

"It's still following us!" Adrian shouted to Tom and June. "Can spells do that?"

"It's a long-range spell!" June called back, her voice filled with urgency. "It can track us for kilometers!"

"The riders are getting closer!" Tom interjected, his voice tense. "And that spell will catch up to us soon!"

Adrian turned to June, his voice urgent. "Can you stop it?"

June's reply held a note of uncertainty. "I'm not sure if I can!"

Tom's voice rang out with determination. "We’ll have to try! We can do this, June!"

Adrian's voice cut through the air. "Well, better hurry up!"

The riders pulled their horses to a halt and turned around. Tom and June gripped their staffs tightly, exchanging a quick glance of determination.

“Just like we trained for, right?” Tom asked, trying to reassure June.

June nodded, a touch of hesitation in her reply. "Just like we trained for."

"Adrian, stay back and be ready to run," Tom commanded.

With their hearts pounding, Tom and June kicked their horses into a gallop once more, charging straight towards the approaching ball of green energy. Their staffs held firmly, they braced themselves for impact.

The gap closed rapidly as they neared the energy ball. 500 meters... 400 meters... 300... 200... 100. Instinctively, both spellcasters raised their staffs, their hands guided by a force beyond their understanding.

In a blinding flash, they collided with the energy ball, an intense heat washing over them. For a brief moment, Tom feared they would be overwhelmed. But then, as if guided by some unseen power, the heat and energy absorbed by their staffs, dissipated into nothingness.

June's chest rose and fell with each breath. Tom stood perplexed for a moment. They did it.

Before they could gather their thoughts, two arrows whizzed through the air, narrowly missing June and Tom. Their assailants fell to the ground just meters away from June and Tom, two riderless horses galloping away. June and Tom both looked back at Adrian, who lowered his bow.

Tom stared at Adrian in awe. "Did you just shoot two arrows at once?" His voice tinged with disbelief.

"We don't have time to dwell on it," Adrian replied, urgency lacing his words. He maneuvered his horse around June and Tom, his gaze scanning the surroundings.

“He shot two arrows at once!” Tom shouted, still in unbelief.

“Who are they?” June asked, her eyes focused on Adrian.

"Elves," Adrian responded, his voice grim. From atop his horse, he examined the fallen elven bodies. "I believe this was a scouting party."

"A scouting party? What for?" Tom interjected, his voice filled with concern.

“I don't know, but I’m pretty sure that’s not a herd of animals we hear in the distance.” Adrian replied. “We must make haste!” Without hesitation, Adrian turned his horse and urged it southward, galloping at full speed. June and Tom followed suit.

---

Adrian spurred the horses forward, urging them to an incredible speed. Tom's mind raced with thoughts about how long the animals could keep up this pace. They continued riding relentlessly until the sun had set, pushing themselves even beyond that point.

Finally, Adrian called for a halt. The horses were exhausted, and both June and Tom felt the weight of weariness upon them.

"We'll camp here. We'll set off again at dawn," Adrian instructed. "Tom, lead the horses towards the river bank, so they can drink. June, let's set up camp."

For the next half hour, they worked in silence, their focus on distant sounds. But the night remained eerily quiet. In the cold and darkness, they decided against lighting a fire. Each of them took turns standing watch for an hour while the others rested.

Tom kept the final watch before dawn. It was quiet all throughout the night. As the sun began to rise in the east, he woke up June and Adrian.

"Anything unusual?" Adrian inquired with a weary voice, tired from the lack of proper sleep.

"Nothing," Tom responded. "Although, I noticed a faint orange glow at the horizon. I initially thought it was the sunrise, but it's coming from the south."

Indeed, a soft hue of orange painted the distant sky, resembling a sunrise, yet appearing in the wrong direction. Adrian stared at the sight for a few moments, lost in thought.

"What could it be?" June asked, her voice tinged with exhaustion.

"I believe we should ride," Adrian replied, avoiding June's question; his mind partially absorbed by his contemplation.

This time, they proceeded at a slower pace, the horses had been able to rest a bit, but hadn't fully recovered.

"Could that be smoke?" Tom remarked after they had been riding for an hour or two.

Adrian's response carried a somber tone. "I'm afraid you might be right."

"Where is it coming from?", June asked cautiously.

Adrian's voice lowered. "There's only one thing around here that could be on fire."

A wave of dread washed over June. "Birchbrook?" she half-questioned, half-stated. 

She was perplexed for a moment. "We must ride and help!", she said when she had gathered her thoughts.

"No, wait." Adrian interjected. "We don't know what's going on, we shouldn't hastily ride into potential danger."

"But people could need our help!" June shouted. 

Without waiting for Adrian's reply, she urged her horse forward, determined to take action. Tom glanced between Adrian and Tom, his indecision lasting only a brief moment. With resolute determination, he too spurred his horse into greater speed.

Adrian followed soon after.

As they approached the village, a sight of devastation unfolded before their eyes. Flames engulfed the buildings, sending plumes of smoke into the sky.

There were no cries for help, only the sound of the fire slowly blazing.
