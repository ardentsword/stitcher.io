36 questions, a podcast unlike any I've ever heard. How come, you ask? 
Well, it counts only three episodes, it tells a romantic story; but most importantly: it's a musical podcast.

That's right, people actually start singing from time to time.

I first discovered 36 questions after doing a google search for… well, "musical podcast". I recently listened to Hamilton, which is a [story for another time](/podcasts/revolutions); and was a little hooked on musicals back then. I wondered if anyone ever considered combining musicals and podcasts together.

To my surprise, there were a handful, but most of them were rather strange, not really what I was looking for: they included music, but not full blown songs. 36 questions did, however; so I gave it a shot.

Since there are only three episodes, I was finished with it after a day, and I probably re-listened it afterwards 4 or 5 times. It's that good! 

The story is unique enough, not some cliche romance, the music is awesome and the voice actors are great. One of the lead characters is portrayed by Jonathan Groff, who also voiced Olaf in Frozen, as well as King George in Hamilton — what a coincidence!

I'd say 36 questions is a unique podcasting experience, unlike anything you've ever heard. I've actually searched for podcasts within the same genre ever since, but wasn't able to find one anywhere close to this one.
