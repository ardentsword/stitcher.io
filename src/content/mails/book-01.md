Hi ::subscriber.first_name::

Naming is hard, no surprises there. I appreciate how many of you have reached out telling me they are looking forward to the upcoming book I'm writing! On top of that though, many told me: "you should change the name" ðŸ˜….

I kind of settled on "Beyond CRUD" because I like the name, I've been using it for years, but also because I couldn't find any better titles. But, you've made clear that a similar name to _Laravel Beyond CRUD_ would be confusing, and that it might negatively impact people's expectations for _this_ book. After all: this book isn't a continuation or second edition of _Laravel Beyond CRUD_, so it seems best to choose another name.

And that's why I'm mailing you today: **I need help picking a better name** because, wellâ€¦ naming is hard ðŸ˜…

So, let me pitch the concept of this book once again, and I hope some of you will reply to me with one or more title suggestions. 

I'm writing a book for PHP programmers. I envision people reading it after they've read the official documentation of their framework of choice, when they notice they need something more than what comes out of the box. It's a book that teaches patterns and principles which help you build larger projects, projects that have a longer runtime, and a bigger team.

Most importantly: it's a book that's meant to inspire more than to teach _"the one and only true way of programmingâ„¢"_. I don't believe there is _one best way_. You can pick and choose what works for you. We'll often implement things from scratch, to truly understand what's going on behind the scenes. I want people to understand, not copy/paste.

Do any ideas come to mind? Let me know by replying to this email, I'd love to hear your input!

Until next time!

PS: Yes I asked ChatGPT, it only came up with titles that were average at best.
